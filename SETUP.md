#### Test installation

To run pytest inside PyCharm set up a new run configuration, "Run > Edit Configurations",
"+ > Python Teat > py.test". As target and working directory set the root directory you
checked out the code into and run the tests.

Some test may fail, because MacOS ain't no Linux, yet.

#### Running from terminal

Cd to the root of the checkout repo, assuong the pybuild virtual env
from previuos steps.

    . .pybuild/bin/activate
    pip3 install -e .
    pytest --pep8 --cov=hadbuild
